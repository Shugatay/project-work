    <p>Our world is an amazing place! Many countries, different nature, very special people - every time we discover the
        world in a new way, despite the fact that we travel to the same country several times a year. Our team has set
        itself the goal of discovering
        for you those countries that we love and appreciate, and where we travel with pleasure. Again and again. We
        decided to write an informative article for you and name the TOP countries where, according to our active
        recreation club, you should definitely
        go!

    <p>Few people have not heard of Norway with its very special culture. This is a country where reality and a fairy
        tale meet - the citizens of Norway believe in trolls with all conviction and know that even in the most ordinary
        environment there is a
        place for a miracle.
        <br>
        <br>Surely, you yourself have heard a lot about Norway - about the country of fjords and Vikings, where from a
        mixture of water in all its states of aggregation, rocks, greenery and a very special atmosphere, an amazing
        world emerges that attracts
        you with its unusualness. Fjords and ferries are a big part of the most popular excursions. People come here to
        look at the rocks from the water, swim through all the fjords, visit the Lofoten Islands, learn more about the
        harsh life of the Vikings
        and go fishing.
        <br>
        <br> We look at Norway from the other side. Active holidays with us are trekking, excursions to untrodden places
        and new places that are unlike anything else. Preacher's Rock, Pea, Troll's Tongue, Folgefonna Glacier, Mount
        Galkhepiggen, Bessegen
        Trail - we see all this with our own eyes and get to know the very soul of Norway!

    <p>Another important place in our trips is occupied by Georgia - a country that is famous for its incredible
        hospitality and original culture. Georgia is not only a country of beach holidays. Of course, Batumi, Ureki and
        Kobuleti cannot be deleted from
        the list of cities that must be visited, but for those who want to fully get acquainted with the sights of the
        country, delve into the foundations of life, appreciate the beauty of nature and touch the secrets of one of the
        most ancient nationalities
        - this is not enough.
        <br>
        <br>Trips of the active recreation club to Georgia have a large excursion component. We not only go to Georgia
        to taste the local cuisine and enjoy wine tastings, but also to touch the secrets of this country with a big
        heart. Caves and cave cities,
        monasteries, fortresses, canyons, waterfalls are just a small part of what we visit on our trips around Georgia.
        We learn about the architectural features of popular ensembles and devote a lot of time to rest - active and not
        very active.

    <p>Iceland has its secrets and invariably excites the imagination. "A country located on another planet" - as it is
        sometimes called. And getting there, we are convinced every time that this is so.
        <br>
        <br>Arriving in Iceland, every time we are amazed by its majestic beauty. Eyjafjallajökull, Krapla, Grimsvetn
        volcanoes, Gelsir and Strokkur geysers, Gullfoss and Skogafoss waterfalls are the hallmark of Iceland, and on
        every our trip we cannot
        afford to miss visiting them. And although the team of our active travel club has repeatedly visited the most
        interesting places in Iceland, every time we are surprised again and again by the inner power that sleeps in the
        bowels of the land of
        the land of fire and ice. If you haven't been to Iceland yet, don't delay! This country is a must to visit! Must
        see!

            <h3>Travel with Shugar</h3>
            <p>Travel planning, finding accommodation and buying tickets take a lot of effort and time, but even this
                has its benefits. In small doses, stress does not hurt, because a little shake-up and a break from the
                routine make us be more collected,
                flexible, find a way out of difficult situations and come up with unusual solutions.</p>
